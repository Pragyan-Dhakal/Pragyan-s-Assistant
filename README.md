Virtual Assistant

#About
This is a Python-based virtual assistant that responds to voice commands and allows users to:
- Open websites (e.g., YouTube, Google, Facebook)
- Perform web searches
- Play YouTube videos

The assistant uses `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3` for voice commands and responses, and `webbrowser` for web interaction. It also integrates with `pywhatkit` to play YouTube videos directly based on voice input.

#Features
- Voice-activated commands:Use voice commands to control the assistant.
- Open any website:Say "open YouTube" or any other website to launch it in your browser.
- Search on Google:You can search anything on Google by saying "search" followed by your query.
- Play YouTube videos:Just say "play" followed by the song or video name to start playing it on YouTube.

#Code Snippet
Hereâ€™s an example of how the assistant handles voice commands to open websites:

```python
# Recognize speech and open YouTube
def process_command(command):
    if command.startswith("open youtube"):
        speak("Opening YouTube")
        webbrowser.open("https://www.youtube.com")

#How to Use

#Step 1: Clone this repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pragyan-Dhakal/Pragyan-s-Assistant.git
   ```

#Step 2: Install Required Packages
Before running the virtual assistant, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
This will install libraries like `speech_recognition`, `pyttsx3`, `pywhatkit`, and others required for the project.

#Step 3: Run the Assistant
To run the virtual assistant, use this command:
   ```bash
   python Virtual_Assistant.py
   ```

Once running, the assistant will ask for a wake word (e.g., "Mika") to activate, and then you can start issuing voice commands.

#Technologies Used
- Python: The core language used for the project.
- speech_recognition: Library used for converting voice input to text.
- pyttsx3: Used for converting text responses into speech.
- webbrowser: Opens web pages directly from voice commands.
- pywhatkit: Used for playing YouTube videos.

#Full Code
You can view the full implementation of the assistant in the file [Virtual_Assistant.py](./Virtual_Assistant.py).

#Future Improvements
Here are some future improvements you could implement:
- Add integration with smart home devices (like Alexa or Google Home).
- Implement more natural language processing to better understand user commands.
- Improve the speed of the response time and accuracy of voice recognition.
